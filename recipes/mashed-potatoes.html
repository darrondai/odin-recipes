    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled, or to taste (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and garlic,

        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the potatoes are almost finished, heat milk and butter in a small
        saucepan over low heat until butter is melted.
